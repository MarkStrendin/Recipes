# Pizza Topping Advice
This is some general advice for building a good pizza, after you've made your dough.

# DO NOT USE PRE-SHREDDED CHEESE ON YOUR PIZZA
Pre-shredded cheese contains anti-sticking agents like corn starch in the bag, so that the shredded pieces don't stick to eachother at the grocery store. This extra stuff will change the taste of your pizza, and might even make a scummy film on top of your cheese.

# Skip shredding your cheese and just rip off clumps of it
The cheese will all melt together anyway, so you can save yourself having to clean a cheese grater if you just rip off clumps of mozerella with your hands and putting those clumps on your pizza directly - you probably won't notice a difference once it's cooked.

If your mozerella is too stiff to rip off clumps, cut it into half-inch cubes with a knife.

# Using pineapple on your pizza
Don't use canned pineapple on your pizza. The canning process changes the flavour of pineapple, and in my opinion, this makes it really gross. I prefer to buy frozen pineapple chunks (usually found by the smoothie ingredients at my local grocery store). I typically microwave a handful of pineapple chunks for about 2 minutes to mostly thaw them out, before using them - you just want to thaw them, not cook them.

Pineapple as-is will bring a lot of unwanted moisture to your pizza, which will come out in the cooking process and make your pizza soggy, if you won't deal with it before-hand. I like to squish my pineapple chunks in some paper towel until the majority of the juice is out - you could probably squish into a sieve and save the juice for another dish, but I don't usually have a use for it.
