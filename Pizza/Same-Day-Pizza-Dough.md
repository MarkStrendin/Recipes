# Same-Day Pizza Dough
Makes 4-5 12 inch pizzas (each of which is plenty for 2 adults)
This pizza dough takes about *8 hours* to make from start to finish. Start this the morning you plan to use it.
Dough can be refrigerated for 3-4 days, or frozen.

# Ingredients
- 1kg Flour (ideally "00" or Pizza flour)
- 700ml Water
- 2g Yeast (1/2 teaspoon)
- 20g Salt
- A small amount of oil, such as Olive Oil (to prevent dough from sticking to things)

# The morning you plan to make pizza
- Heat water to around 35C (90F to 95F)
- Put 2g Yeast in a small dish and add about 3 tablespoons of the warm water. Set aside (uncovered).
- In a large bowl, combine 1kg flour and the rest of the warm water.
- Mix until loosely combined, cover, and set aside on countertop for 30 minutes.

# 30 minutes later - Combine into final dough mixture
- Gently mix the yeast mixture to make it more uniform (I do this by swishing the container around a bit)
- Dust the dough ball with 20g salt
- Pour yeast mixture overtop of dough ball
- Mix by hand (using wet hands) until a uniform ball of dough forms (it will eventually all combine, just keep mixing). It may be easier to do this on a countertop rather than a bowl, depending on the size and structure of your bowl.
- Squish the dough ball a bit and fold it over itself once
- Squish again, and fold over again, perpendicular to the direction you folded first
- Put a small amount of oil in your bowl
- Form into a ball, set aside in a covered bowl for at least 60 minutes.

# 60 minutes later - fold the dough
- Reach under the dough and grab a bit of it from the bottom, and fold the dough up and over itself
- Fold it the same way a second time, perpendicular from the first time you folded.
- Let sit for about 6 hours.

# 6 hours later - dividing into 4-5 portions
- Lightly flour a countertop or workspace
- With floured hands, pull dough out of bowl and work it into an even shape
- Using a sharp knife, cut dough into even sized portions. Do not rip, break, or twist the dough.
- (Extremely) lightly cover the dough balls with some oil
- Set aside portions
  - Portions you are going to use today should be set aside, covered, on the countertop for 30-60 minutes before baking
  - Portions you are going to save for later can go into covered containers and refrigerated overnight.
  - You can freeze portions, but let them spend the night in the refrigerator first.

# Using frozen dough
 - Thaw in refrigerator for at least 12 hours
 - Let dough sit on room-temperature countertop for 30-60 minutes before use

# Ready to assemble your pizza
You can now use your dough to assemble and cook some pizza. See my page on [Pizza Topping Considerations](Pizza-Topping-Considerations.md) for some important considerations for assembling your final pizza, no matter what dough you are using.
