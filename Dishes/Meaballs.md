# Meatballs

## Ingredients
- 125g breadcrumbs (Panko works very well) or quick oats
- 125ml water or milk or cream
- ~ 1kg of ground meat
  - You could do half ground beef and half ground pork
  - Try mixing in lamb, turkey, chicken
- 2 large eggs
- 25g grated or powdered parmesan cheese
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 to 1 onion, chopped finely (or 3-5 tablespoons of dehydrated onion)

## Steps
 - Optionally caramelize any onions you are adding by simmering them in a frying pan with oil for 30-60 minutes.
 - Combine all ingredients into a large bowl and mix well with a large wooden spoon or with clean hands.
 - With your hands, shape mixture into balls.
 - If cooking immediately, proceed to cook them, otherwise place on a baking tray lined with parchment, wax paper, foil, or plastic wrap. When your tray is full, or you are out of mixture, cover and place in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, place in a freezer safe container or zip bag.

## Cooking
 - Bake at 350째F (176째C) for 35-40 minutes, or
 - Brown in a frying pan over medium heat for approximately 15 minutes.

Meatballs are cooked when their internal temperature is at least 71째C (160째F).
