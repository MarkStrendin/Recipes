# Hard Boiled Eggs
The inside of a hard boiled egg should be entirely yellow, and almost a jelly like consistency. 
If there are gray bits, or if the yolk crumbles like powder, you have an overcooked egg.

# Ingredients
 - Some eggs (I usually cook 6-12 at a time)
 - Some water

# Steps
 - Place uncooked eggs in a pot of __cold__ water, and place on the stove. Cover with lid or foil. Use enough water to completely cover the eggs.
 - Turn on heat, and bring water to a boil.
 - Once the water is boiling, turn the burner off, but do not remove the pot.
 - Let sit for 12 minutes.
 - Remove eggs from hot water, and place them in a bowl of cold water, to stop them from cooking. I typically cycle the cold water a few times as well.
 - Refrigerate, and consume within 5 days.
