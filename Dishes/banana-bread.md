# Banana Bread

Time to prepare: 15-20 minutes preparation, 60 minutes baking

You'll need 1 loaf pan (9in by 5in, 23cm by 13cm), 2 mixing bowls, some aluminum foil, some measuring cups, and either an electric mixer or a wooden spoon for mixing. 

## Ingredients
 - 2 Cups / 250g all-purpose flour
 - 1 teaspoon baking soda
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
 - 1/2 cup / 125ml / 115g butter (room temperature)
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 3/4 cup / 150g brown sugar
 - 2 large eggs (room temperature)
 - 1/3 cup / 80g plain yogurt (room temperature)
 - 2 cups / 475g mashed banana (4 large ripe/overripe banans)
 - Optional: A handful (~100g) chopped nuts such as walnuts, or raisins, or chocolate chips
 

## Steps
 - Several hours before you start, set out butter, eggs, and yogurt on the counter so that they warm up to room temperature.
 - In a medium sized mixing bowl, combine 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Whisk together until mixed.
 - In a seperate (larger) mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup butter with 3/4 cup brown sugar until smooth and creamy
 - Add 2 eggs to butter/brown sugar mixture, mix together well
 - Add 2 cups mashed bananas to the butter/brown sugar mixture, mix together until there are no large chunks of banana left
 - Add 1/3 cup yogurt and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to butter/brown sugar mixture, mix until combined
 - Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until the flour mixture is completely mixed in
 - If using optional nuts/raisins/chocolate chips, mix them in now
 - Set oven to 350째F (176째C)
 - Grease (or spray with cooking spray) your loaf pan
 - Pour the batter mixture into your loaf pan, and use a spatula to level out the top as best you can
 - Place loaf pan in oven, and use some aluminum foil to make a loose "tent" over the top of the loaf pan (fold it into an upside-down "V" shape and gently drape it overtop of the loaf pan). This should **not** be sealed or airtight, just gently placed over the top of the loaf pan. This protects the top of the loaf from burning from the direct heat of the oven.
 - Bake for 60 minutes, at 350째F (176째C). The Banana Bread is done when a toothpick/fork/chopstick inserted into the centre comes out clean (with only crumbs, no goopy batter). If not ready after 60 minutes, check after 5 minute intervals. 
 - When ready, remove the loaf pan from the oven and place on an unused stovetop (or other heat-safe surface) to cool. Allow the banana bread to cool in the loaf pan for at least 30 minutes, ideally 1 hour.
 - Shake the loaf pan to loosen the banana bread loaf, and overturn onto a wire rack or cutting board.
 - Do not refrigerate or freeze until it's cooled to room temperature (1-2 hours)

 For best results, serve in slices with room temperature butter.
