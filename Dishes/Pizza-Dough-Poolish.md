# A lecture on using pre-shredded cheese on your pizza
**Do not use pre-shredded cheese on your pizza.**. Pre-shredded cheese contains anti-sticking agents like corn starch in the bag, so that the shredded pieces don't stick to eachother at the grocery store. This extra stuff will change the taste of your pizza, and might even make a scummy film on top of your cheese.

For best results, rip off clumps of cheese with your hands - it will all melt together anyway, and you won't have to wash a cheese grater. If you're using a cheese that isn't easily ripped into clumps, cut it into 1/2" cubes.

 - Let dough sit on room-temperature countertop for 30-60 minutes before use
