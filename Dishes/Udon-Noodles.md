# Udon Noodles

Serves: 2+

## Ingredients
 - [udon noodle sauce](/Sauces/Udon-Noodle-Sauce.md), prepared as per recipe and set aside
 - 1-2 tablespoons of cooking oil, ideally peanut, safflower, or sunflower
 - 2 packets udon noodles 
   - typically found in imported foods shelves at the grocery store
   - You might be able to find these fresh near the produce at the store. Stores near me have them infrequently by the tofu or fresh mushrooms.
 - 1-2 cups mushrooms, sliced or quartered
   - Any kind of mushrooms will work, I typically buy crimini because that's what the stores near me sell
 - 2-5 stalks of green onion, sliced into chunks 1-2 inches long
 - 1-2 stalks of bok choy, sliced
 - 1-2 large handfuls of sugar snap peas (in shell)
 - 1-2 handfuls of green beans
 - 4 chicken thighs (skin on)
   - Or alternatively 1/2 package of pork belly, skin removed
   - Or alternatively a few handfuls of shrimp
 - Salt and pepper

## Steps
 - If you haven't made the [udon noodle sauce](/Sauces/Udon-Noodle-Sauce.md) already, prepare this now
 - If using vacuum packed udon noodles, remove from package, place in water and heat until noodles are loose. Heat may not actually be required. Drain and set aside.
 - Heat oil in a wok or large frying pan
 - Add meat (chicken thighs / pork belly / shrimp) and cook until no longer raw, adding salt and pepper to taste. Make sure raw meat is cooked through before adding additional ingredients.
 - Add mushrooms, peas, and beans, cook until mushrooms are soft and peas/beans can be sliced with a fork
 - Add bok choy, green onion, noodles, and sauce
 - Stir all ingredients together while they cook for a few minutes. Stop when the vegetables reach the consistency you prefer.
