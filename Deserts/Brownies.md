# Brownies

Just a brownie recipe that works for me, that's more on the "fudge" side of the brownie-spectrum, and less on the "cake" side.

## Ingredients
 - 2 large eggs
 - 1/2 cup butter, melted
 - 1/2 cup white granulated sugar
 - 3/4 cup brown sugar
 - 1 tablespoon liquid cooking oil (I typically use coconut, but any oil should work)
 - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
 - 1/2 cup flour
 - 1/2 cup cocoa powder
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - Optional
   - 1-2 handfuls of semi-sweet chocolate chips
   - 1-2 handfuls of white chocolate chips
   - 1-2 handfuls of walnuts

## Steps
 - Preheat oven to 350F
 - Grease a square baking dish, or line with baking parchment paper
 - Combine flour, salt, and cocoa powder in a bowl and whisk together
 - In a separate bowl, combine melted butter, cooking oil, vanilla, and both sugars together in a bowl, and mix together well
 - Mix eggs into wet mixture and beat well
 - Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until combined. If adding extras like chocolate chips or walnuts, add them now. Try to be gentle and avoid overmixing this. 
 - Pour mixture into baking dish and spread as evenly as you can
 - Bake for 25 minutes, then remove from oven.
 - Let cool until the top is close to room temperature before cutting/eating - about 30-60 minutes (depending on the temperature of your kitchen)
