# No-Bake Cheesecake

This cake takes time to set, so you will want to make it the day before you plan to serve it.

## Ingredients
 - 240g graham cracker crumbs
 - 100g unsalted butter (melted)
 - 300ml whipping cream
 - 675 bricks cream cheese
  - 3 8oz packages, as my local grocery store sells cream cheese.
 - 100g granulated sugar
 - 15g (2tbsp) icing/confectioners' sugar
 - 60g (1/4 cup) sour cream
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 1-2 cans pie filling (I recommend cherry or blueberry) for topping. Fresh berries, lemon pie filling, or dulce de Leche are other good options.
   
## Before you start
 - Let the cream cheese and sour cream get to room temperature by setting these out on your counter a few hours before you start.

## Steps
 - Melt the butter (should be completely liquid)
 - Mix the graham crumbs and butter, and press the mixture down into whatever pan or dish you will be using for the cake. Compact it with the back of a spoon as best you can. Set aside, ideally in a refidgerator.
 - Use a mixer to whip the whipping cream until it forms stiff peaks - approximately 5-6 minutes, and set aside.
 - In a separate bowl, add the cream cheese and granulated sugar together, and mix with an electric mixer until smooth.
 - To the cream cheese mixture, add the icing/confectioners' sugar, sour cream, and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and no large lumps of cream cheese remain.
 - Mix the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until smooth. If you want the cake to be lighter and fluffier, do this carefully by hand with a spatula, trying to keep the air in the whipped cream as much as possible.
 - Pour the cream cheese mixture into your cake pan overtop of the graham crust, and smooth the top with a spatula. Refrigerate overnight (or at least 4 hours).
 - Top with pie filling just before serving.
