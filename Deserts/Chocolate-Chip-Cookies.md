# Chocolate Chip Cookies

It's best to chill this dough anywhere from 2 to 72 hours before baking it. It will freeze well if you freeze it immediately (so it can "chill" while it thaws).

Can be made by hand, no electric mixer required.
Makes 20-25 cookies.

## Ingredients
- 280g all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 & 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 170g butter (melted)
- 100g granulated Sugar
- 150g brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 100g to 225g chocolate chips/chunks

## Steps
 - Whisk flour, baking soda, cornstarch, salt together in a bowl.
 - In a separate bowl, melt butterT
 - To the melted butter, add brown sugar, granulated sugar and mix well.
 - Add egg and egg yolk to butter/sugar mixture and mix well.
 - Add vanilla extract to butter/sugar/egg mixture and mix well.
 - Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix together until combined.
 - Fold in chocolate chips.

 The cookie dough is now complete but you should chill it for at least an hour before baking into cookies. Alternatively, freeze dough and thaw and bake later.

 - Roll into rough balls and bake at 325°F (163°C) for 11-14 minutes - until the top and edges are lightly browned. 
 - Let cool on the baking sheet you used for at least 10 minutes before attempting to move. After 10-20 minutes move cookies to a cooling rack if possible.

 Consume cookies within 1-2 days.
