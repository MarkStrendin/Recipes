# Chocolate Chip Cookies

It's best to chill this dough anywhere from 2 to 72 hours before baking it. It will freeze well if you freeze it immediately (so it can "chill" while it thaws).

Can be made by hand, no electric mixer required.

## Ingredients
- 280g all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 & 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 170g butter
- 100g granulated Sugar
- 150g brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 large egg yolk
- 2 teasponns vanilla extract
- 225g semi-sweet chocolate chips/chunks


## Steps
 - For best results let the butter and eggs reach room temperature.
 - Whisk flour, baking soda, cornstarch, salt together in a bowl.
 - Melt the butter in a separate bowl.
 - To the melted butter, add brown sugar, granulated sugar and mix well.
 - Add egg and egg yolk to butter/sugar mixture and mix well.
 - Add vanilla extract to butter/sugar/egg mixture and mix well.
 - Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and mix together until combined.
 - Fold in chocolate chips.
 - For best results, chill dough for at least 2 hours (up to 72 hours). Freeze dough if you need to go beyond 72 hours.
 - Roll into balls and bake at 325°F (163°C) for 11-14 minutes - until the top and edges are lightly browned. Remove pan from oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely.
