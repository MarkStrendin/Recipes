# Orange Salad
I'm not sure why we call this dish Orange Salad, or where this recipe originally came from. This is a typical family dish around Thanksgiving or Christmas time. While it's very "deserty", we serve this with the main meal as a side dish, separate from any desert (think of it as a replacement for cranberry sauce).

## Ingredients
 - 2 Small Jello Gelatin packages, Orange Flavour
   - The 85g packages that have 4 servings in them
   - Probably other brands will work just fine, it doesn't need to be Jello
 - 1 Cup water (hot/boiling, for making the Jello gelatin)
 - 1 Can (398ml) Crushed Pinapple, drained (Do not use fresh pineapple, it will prevent the gelatin from setting)
 - 1 Can (398ml) Mandarin Orange sections, drained   
 - 2 Envelopes of Dream Whip whipped cream mix (or 1 cup of whipped cream)
  - The recipe I was given specifically calls for Dream Whip, but really you just need 1 cup of prepared whipped cream.
 - 1 Cup Milk (for Dream Whip - if you are using different whipped cream, then skip this)
 - 1/2 Cup Milk
 - 1/2 Cup Mayonnaise 
 - 1/2 Tsp Vanilla
 - Optional: 5-10 Maraschino Cherries for garnish

## Steps
 - If using Dream Whip mix, mix 2 envelopes of Dream Whip mix, as per the instructions on the box/package. Set aside for now.
   - 1 cup Milk, 1/2 Tsp Vanilla in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. 
 - If NOT using Dream Whip mix, prepare 1 cup of whipped cream, however you prefer to do this. Set aside for now.
 - Heat 1 Cup water to almost boiling, and mix with all of the orange Jello gelatin powder until combined. You will be making the Jello gelatin with less water than the package instructs, because it will be getting that water from the other ingredients in this recipe. Do not add additional water to the jello mix - 1/2 cup per package only.
 - Put Jello mix in the refrigerator for 5 minutes. Do not let it completely set - you just want to cool it down.
 - Drain the canned pineapple and orange sections. You don't want to use the liquid they came packed in (save it for something else, or drink it!)
 - Set 5-10 orange slices aside for garnish (you'll need these when the gelatin is set, in 4+ hours, so put them in the fridge for now).
   - Optionally, you may want to blitz the orange slices in a blender, if you want a smoother final dish.
 - To the Jello mixture, add 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup mayonnaise, and the crushed pineapple and oranges. Mix with an electric mixer for a minute or two, until combined as best as possible.
 - Using a whisk or the lowest setting on an electric mixer, combine whipped cream and the Jello mixture.
 - Transfer mixture into a large glass serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.
 - Before serving, add orange slices (and optional cherries) to the top as garnish.
