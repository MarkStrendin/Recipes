# Orange Salad
I'm not sure why we call this dish Orange Salad, or where this recipe originally came from. This is a typical family dish around Thanksgiving or Christmas time. While it's very "deserty", we serve this with the main meal as a side dish, separate from any desert (as a sort of replacement for cranberry sauce, I guess).

## Ingredients
 - 2 Small Jello Gelatin packages, Orange Flavour
   - The 85g packages that have 4 servings in them
 - 1 Cup water
 - 1 Can (398ml) Crushed Pinapple
 - 1 Can (398ml) Mandarin Orange sections
 - 2 Envelopes of Dream Whip whipped cream mix
 - 1/2 Cup Mayonnaise
 - 1 & 1/2 Cup Milk
 - 1/2 Tsp Vanilla
 - Optional: 5-10 Maraschino Cherries for garnish

## Steps
 - Mix 2 envelopes of Dream Whip mix, 1 cup Milk, 1/2 Tsp Vanilla in a bowl and mix with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form (in other words, make 2 packages of Dream Whip mix as instructed on the package). Set whipped cream aside for now.
 - Heat 1 Cup water to almost boiling, and mix with all of the orange Jello gelatin powder until combined.
 - Put Jello mix in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes. Do not let it completely set - you just want to cool it down.
 - Drain the canned pineapple and orange sections. Set 5-10 orange slices aside for garnish (you'll need these *tomorrow* so put them in the fridge for now).
   - Optionally, you may want to blitz the orange slices in a blender, if you want a smoother final dish.
 - To the Jello mixture, add 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 chip mayonnaise, and the crushed pineapple and oranges. Mix with an electric mixer for a minute or two, until combined as best as possible.
 - Using the lowest setting on an electric mixer, combine whipped cream and the Jello mixture until combined.
 - Transfer mixture into a large glass serving bowl, cover, and refrigerate **overnight**.
 - Before serving, add orange slices (and optional cherries) to the top as garnish.
